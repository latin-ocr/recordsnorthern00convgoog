government at once stopped appeals to the English
courts, and, again following English precedent, expelled
from Scotland all those barons whose possessions in
England were greater than in Scotland. Mercantile
relations with France followed, and, finally, in July, 1295,
Edward Balliol, the king’s eldest son, was betrothed to
Scotch Joan of valois, the niece of the French king.
Edward of England promptly demanded the surrender of
three border castles, and, on the rejection of his demand,

cited King John to appear before him at Berwick on
March 1st, 1296.

Edward was obviously in a difficult position. His
hold on Wales was still uncertain; he was already
involved in a war with France; and, in particular, his
finances were radically unsound, Hence his best, indeed
his only possible, answer to the defiance of France and
Scotland was the issue of writs of summons to a ‘⁴ Model
Parliament,'’ in which the assembly of clergy, for which
the machinery already existed, should be consolidated
with the Parliament secured by writs addressed to the
baronage and sheriffs. This was done in the early days
oi October, 1295, and, as our documents show, the
province of York was treated in the same uray as that ol
Canterbury. But, as our documents again prove, no
national system of taxation had yet been evolved. The
orders deliberated apart, the barons and knights, the
citios and boroughs, and the elergy ol the two provineeS,
all made separate agreements with the king.

The French expedition was of no value at all, and
by Eastcr, 1297, a truce had been concludcd ulrich leit
almost all Gascony in Freneh hands, but the case was
very different as regards Scotland. Edward had pro·
nouneed Balliol contumacious on his lailure to appear
at hennei, and promptly advanced against that town.
Berwiclr and then Dunbar fell, after which the king
and Rislrop ssek, with the Durham men, made what was
little amre than a military progress through Scotland.
