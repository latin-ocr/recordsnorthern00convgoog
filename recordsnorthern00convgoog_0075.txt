In 14'17 came a change. A Convocation was held
this year at York, on the Archbishop's Mandate ; and
Bishop Langley’s Register says clearly that this was
‘⁸ sine brevi regi0.''* lt was summoned to strengthen
the shakeu unity ol the Choreb, and to advance the
much needed reformation ol it. For. between the Great
Schism and the quick spread of lollard opinions, which
included startling views as to both priesthood and
sacramente, the Bishops lelt their footing precarious and
in danger. This waS, perhaps, the beginning in the North
ol a movement against these new and subversive ideas,
coupled with the undertaking ot a relorm ol some kind
within the Churcli. Canterbury harl been hard at work
on 'these subjects lor some time past.

lt was just at this time that we meet with a very
singular proposal lor amendmeut, addressed to Convoca-

trainers ol men to eope with these distresses. Thus it
was that Convocatiou, sitting lrom September, 1421, to
Jauuary, 1422, bad under consideration ‘⁴ a vast number
ol lamentable propositione and complaints on behall ol

the UniversitieS‚'' and undertook to consider seriously
their grievauce and the claims ol graduates lor such
