⁰ On February 5th, 1452, Archbishop Kempe issued a
licence to University College, Oxford‚ granting the College
power to send a proctor to appear in Convocation lor five
years, on account ol their appropriation ol the benefice
ol Amclifle. This is Amclifie in Craven, Yorkshire, a
village in the Wharledale. It continued in their possession
till a very lew years ag0‚ when it was sold by University
College to the present Vicar. The College still holds the
great tithes there and is Rector ol the parish. Thc
permission ol Archbishop Kempe is printed here, because
it shows that so late as the middle ol the filteenth century
considerable latitude existed as to the persons qualified to
sit in the Northern Convocation ; as we also see by tho
document which states that the Prior oi Finchale‚ as Rector
ol Gigleswick‚ had a seat, and did appoint a Proctor to
serve in Convocation on his behall.
