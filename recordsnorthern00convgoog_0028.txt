Pheraeis. vii

Edward wrote to the two Archbishops to let them
know that he was in great need of an Aid. By this he

recognized a right pertaining to their office of Archbishop,
namely, that ol summoning, on reeeipt of a royal writ„
the Bishops of their provinces to attend in person at the
provincial Synods The term Convocation in the modern
sense of it does not appear as yet. At the same time
he told the two Archbishops to instruct their Bishops to
summon their ArchdeaconS, and their heads of Chapters
and Convents‚ to appear ; and finally he took a long step in
advanee; for he furthermore bade, through the Arch-
bishops, the Bishops to let their Arehdeacons know that
they must inform their clergy also to send representativos
to the coming synod.

Thus sprang into life a body entirely unknown
elsewhere: it was a body destined to be a larger form of
synod, and also quite distinct from all older consultative
bodies ; it was to be an assembly parallel with Parliament,
now just coming into full life, and yet itself distinct from
Parliament, and no part of one. Yet so late a writer as
Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen, in one of his Essays‚ following
Hooker, speaks of Convocation as annexed to Parliament.*

To a certain extent, as we have seen, representation
had been recognized in England before this epoch. Thus,
in a national synod held at st. Paul's, London, in 1237,
some persons appeared with letters of authorization.
We are not told who had issued them; those who
presented them are described as “literas procuratorias
deferentes” Again‚ in 1252, Archbishop Gray and his

suffragans addressed to Henry ΙΙΙ a letter which Mr.
Raine, in his edition of Gray's Register, speaks ol as ‘¹ Α
letter from the heads of the Northem Convocation to
Henry Ill about the joint aetion of the two Convoca-
