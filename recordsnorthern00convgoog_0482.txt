to it, All my neighbours eall on me to concur in the
treaty between Holland and Spain; and the honour of
the nations will not suffer the Hollanders to be abandoned,
especially after so much mony and men spent in their
quarrel. Therefore 1 was of the mind to eall my clergy
together, to satisfy not so much me as the world, about
uS, of the justness of my owning the Hollanders at this
time. This I needed not have done, and you have forced
me to say, Ι wish 1 had not. You have dipped too deep
into what all kings reservo among the “ areana imperii.”
And whatever aversion you may profess against God's
being the author of sin, you have stumbled upon the
threshold of that opinion, in saying upon the matter,
that even tyranny is God's authority, and should be
revereneed as such. If the King of Spain should return
to claim his old pontifieal right to my kingdom, you
leave me to seek for others to fight for it ; for you tell us
upon the matter before hand, his authority is God's
authority, if he prevail. fThus far the secretary's hand,

as Ι take it; the rest follows in the King's own handl.

Mr. Doctor. Ι have no time to express my mind
further in this thorny business, Ι shall give my orders
about it by llr. Solieit0r‚ and until then meddle no more
in it, for they are edge tools, or rather, like that weapon,
that's said to cut with one edge and cure with the other.
Ι commit you to God's protection good Doctor Abbot

and rest Your good friend,

James R.

dignitaries to Convocations; and for the most part they
were doubtless the persons at the head of the Cathedral
clergy, though this sometimes would not suit the ease.
