at the Canterbury and Carlisle Registries, in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, at the Lambeth Library, as well as
in the Cathedral Library at Durham. l owe, also warm
thanks to all who have given me access and willing help ;
specially to my kind friend ΜΓ. W. J. Hardy, whose
profound knowledge and help is always willingly given to
puzzled searchers; to llr. H. A. Hudson and the staff of
the York Registry; to hlr. A. N. Bowman, Registrar of
Carlisle Cathedral; and ΜΓ. S. W. Kershaw, Librarian of
Lambeth Palace. From these kind friends l have ever
found willing help in my somewhat tiresome enquiries

lt only remains forme to refer briefly to the plan
of this volume. lt contains, between the Introduction
and the documents proper, a few “Common Forms,”
printed once for all ; then comes a Chronological statement
of the successive meetings of Convocation, with documents
to show the manner of constitutional life in that body,

and how it has been affected by important events and
movements in the general history of England. At the
end of this, which forms the bulk of the work, are a number
of Appendices, which, it is hoped, may be of interest in
their bearing not only on Convocation itself, but still
more on the general history of our Church and country.

A wish has been expressed for lists of the Members
at different times. For this materials are wanting.
ln the first three centones of the history of Convocation
the names are very rarely mentioned; and l am not
aware of a single complete list. After the Reformation
there are frequent lists, of which specimens are given. lt
is unfortunate that we have so few reliable statements as
to the numbers and persons of the early Convocatious.

Finally, my warmest thanks are due to my friend
the Rev. J. T. Fowler, D.C.L., Honorary Canon of
