Damascus in 1148 had been ascribed to their treachery,
the disasters ot st. Louis in Egypt to the same cause,
while a long series ol accusations of the same character
indicates the general opinion that their dealings with the
Infidels were more intimate than became a Christian
Order. There is necessarily an element oi truth in the
accusation. Continuous hostility to the unbelievers
might be an excellent theory to proclaim in France or
England ; in practice, and in Syria, at least an intermittent
peace was inevitable. A territorial power, as the Order
strove to become in the East, was bound to have
occasional diplomatic relations with its neighbours,
whether Christian or Infidel. Again‚ the same attempts
at territorial development on the part of the Order explain
their hostility to the interierence of a European king in
Eastem affairs.

More serious and more doubtlul were the insinuations
which lor at least half a century had been directed against
the laith and morals ol the Order. These have been
examined with great care by Michelet and, even more
elaborately, by Loiseleur‚ with the result that one cannot
pronounce definitely as to the truth or lalsehood of the
accusations lt appears however, to be well established
that the rite ol initiation did include the ‘⁴ spuitio super
crucem ''—perhaps in the same way as the initiate in
the modem Malia is reported to certily his courage by
firing at a crucifix. lt is also clear that on the Continent,
except in France and at Florence, they were held to be
innocent of the charges brought against them. On the
other hand, it is at least probable that the French province
ol the Order was infected by Satanism and other strange
heresies as well as by the practice ol nameless Oriental
vices.

lt was not, however, to any decline in their saith
and morals but to the political conditions ol Westem
Europe that the sall ol the Templars was due. Their
accumulated wealth made them an object ol jealousy,
