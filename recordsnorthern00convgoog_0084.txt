1¹¹ 1502 Convocation was asked to construet a prayer for
the King. ln 1503 it voted a tenth against ‘¹ the perfidious
Turk.'' This vote, with others, was given under certain

conditione following up the old understanding that such ,

VOtes were part of a bargain between the two parties.
In 1505 the House advanced with the prayers for the
King. They were ordered to be offered up in all churehes.

were arranged for Cardinal Wolsey‚ and cover the ground
from 1257 to the opening of the sixteenth century.

ln 1514, WoIsey, being then Legate as well as Arch-
bish0p‚ Convocation was summoned by him to meet as
usual in Yorlr Minster Chapter House. No sooner were
they settled there than the Archbishop to their con·
stemation‚ at once adjoumed them to Westminster,
where he promised to meet them. He also called on the
Southern Convocation, at that time sitting in St. Paul'S,
to remove to Westminster. The Southenr Houses

this; their obedience was due only to his Grace of
Canterbury, and a fresh summons had to be issued.
Wolsey wanted to hold a Legatine National Synod

composed of both Convocations.† Cardinaf Pole took a
similar step some years later.

There is a darkened look on the countenance ol
Convocation in the session of 1523, for it sat under the
presidency of Wolsey, and felt the ominous shadow of
Henry Vlll's personality. It met first in Wolsey's
Palace at Westminster; then in the Abbey, probably in
