de Lafford,” so that Bishop Suffield was calling on the
chief Rural Dean ol Lincoln Diocese, for Laflord is
not far from Lincoln. And the Lincolnshire Dean ot
Christianity is called on also to stop the desecrations
which were taking place in the churchyards oi Lincoln
City. This was in 1294.

Though in the middle ages we find the Archdeacon
already superior to the Archpriest, still, as White Kennet
tells us in his Paroclrial Antiquilies (II, 345), “the
antiquity ol the Deans ol Christianity was much greater,
and their office more honourable than that ol the Arch-
deacons'’ As, however, the archidiaconal office extended
in authority over a larger area than that occupied by
the ArchpriestS, and came into iar closer communication
with the Bishop ol the Diocese, the Archdeacon soon
grew to be the more important of the two, so that, while
the one could be said to be at the head oi the priesthood,
and the other had in theory only the care of the diaconate,
the Archdeacon has ever been distinctly above the
Rural Dean, even though the latter might be the Dean of
Christianity.

Somner, in his Glossary, says ol this office, “ quam
recentiores Decanum Ruralem, et exteri ‘Archipresby
terum vicarium,’ antiquiores Angli ‘Decanum Christia-
nitatis' vocarunt,'' so attaching this office to the name
oi Archpriest. And Gihson, speaking with some hesitation
in his Codex Juris Ecclesiae Anglicanae says that
it was only the “ Decanus Urbanus '⁹ who was styled
the Dean ol Christianity. This seems to be correct.
Mostly these officers were attached to Cathedral cities;
not always: we lind one at an early time at Ripon.

There is a variation in the title in a document ol
Mechlin in the Low Countries, where the “ Archipresbyteri
seu Christianitatum Decani '' are named ; and in another
place we read, at the head ol arow ol querieS, “An Decani
Christianitatum suis Christianitatibus diligenter super·
intendant? ” This phrase occurs in Articles ot Enquiry
