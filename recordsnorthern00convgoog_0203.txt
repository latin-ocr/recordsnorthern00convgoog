76 Recorrus or 1111

Ι1 should be noted that this Convocation was rather a
Diocesan Synod than a proper assembly ol the Northem
Province; though the torm and manner ol the Writ is as
was usual lor a Convocation, as was also the vote ola
subsidy. Still, the whole beneficed clergy were to be
summoned. and there is nothing said about representation
by Proctors. In the margin it is spoken ot as a Convocatiou.

xxxiv. A Convocation was summoned by Archbishop
William ol Melton lor lhe rst October, 1338, though he
states that he could not personally appear.

xxxv. This Royal Writ has a special interest, *as
il names Prince Edward. The “Black Princo ” was born
in 133o; so that his honours ol Duke of Cornwall, Earl ol
Chester, and ‘¹ Warden ol England‚” must have been
conterred on him almost in his inlancy. He was made
Prince ol Wales in 1343. We learn the date ol this document
lrom the King's Register‚ which enters it under 13 Edw. ΙΙΙ,
tiu, 1339. The Archbishop W. is William ol Melton; aud
the. J„ Archbishop ol Canterbury, is John ol 8111110111,
Bishop ol Winchester 1323-1333, and hrchbishop from
1333 to 1348. The following Writ shows that Edward ΙΙΙ
had no very definite rule as to the persons to he summoned
as rnemhers ol Convocation: he instructs the Archbishop
to call up ‘⁶ alii beneficiati, quos expedire videritis‚'' so
apparently leaving the choice to him.
