Good doctor Abbot,

Ι cannot abstain to give you my judgement ol your
proceedings in your convocation, as you eall it ; and both
as “rex in soli0,’' and “ unus gregis in ecclesia,'' I am
doubly coneemed. My title to the crown no body calls
in question, but they that neither love you nor me ; and
you guess whom Ι mean. All that you and your brethren
have said of a King in possession (for that word, I tell
you, is no worse than that you make use ol in your canon) ’
concems me not at all ; Ι am the next heir, and the crown
is mine by all rights you can name, but that ol conquest;
and Mr Solicitor has sufficiently expressed my own
thoughts conceming the nature of Kingship in general,
and concerning the nature of it “ut in mea persona ’';
and 1 believe you were all ol his opinion; at least none
ol you said ought contrary to it, at the time he spake to
you from me. But you know all ol you, as 1 think,
that my reason ol calling you together was to give your
judgements how lar a christian and a protestant King
may concur to assist his neighbours to shake ofl their
obedience to their once sovereign, upon the account of
oppression, tyranny, or what else you like to name it.
In the late Queen's time this Kingdom was very free in
assisting the Hollanders both with anns and advice.
And none ol your coat ever told me that any scrupled
about it in her reign. Upon my coming to England
you may know that it came lrom some ol yourselves to
raise scruples about this matter. And albeit Ι have olten
told my mind conceming “jus regium in subditoS,'’ as
in May last in the Starehamber, upon the occasion ol
Hales his pamphlet, yet l never took any notice ol these
scruples till the affairs ol Spain and Holland lore’d me
