With regard to the Convocation Records of the
Province of York, Ι beg to submit the following
observations :-

Ι. Tne Arrenruerscopnr Rnrnsrnns—These Ι have
searched from the year 1276 to 1545, and in the subjoined
chronological summary have noted all the references to
Convocation proeeedings which Ι have found. Most of
these are noted brielly in Wilkins’ Concilio, but not all.
If the publication ol the proceedings be resolved on, it
will, Ι think, be sufficient in the majority of cases to
give under each year the dates and the abstract of
the business as noted in this list, adding frorn com-
parison with Wilkins anything noted by him which may
be thought desirahle, which may not seldom be the case.
But then there are many other cases in which entire
documents, or portions of documents, should be printed,
collatiug W ilkins' text, when given by him, with the MS,
except where Ι mysell have here supplied the collation.
Various documents, however, will have to be wholly
copied, as not having been printed by him at all, l have
marked all those which specially deserve notice, whether
already printed or not, with red ink in the margin. Some

of the formal writs and citations are interesting historically
from their containing reference to the occasions which
caused the demand for a subsidy. At a rough guess Ι
think the extracts would altogether make about 170 to
180 pageS, or possibly 200, of ordinary type in octavo
conesponding to the Sortees Society publications.
