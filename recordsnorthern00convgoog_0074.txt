was present and presided, still Convocation stubbomly
refused to vote an aid. After another prorogation “ they
were at last overcome by our prayers and urgency, and
voted a tenth, and even then the Church of York, and
certain religious houseS, claimed exemption.'' The
following entry is common in these times : ‘¹ post magnam
altercationem ac varias excusationes tandem unam
medietatem aegre concedebant.'’

ln 1410 the Archbishop produced a new argument:
the “horrendum illud scisma,'’ that Great Schism‚ which
was one of the worst periods for Popes and churchmen,
had begun. Benedict (1394) was sitting as Pope at La
Spezia, Gregory Xll (1406) at Lucca. The Italian
Cardinals on the side* of Gregory were only eight in
number, and they withdrew from Lucca to Pisa.
Benedict’s supporters were almost all French or other
outside Cardinals It was to meet this ugly state ol
things that Archbishop Henry Bowet issued his mandate
for a Convocation to be held in order to consider how this
evil might be stayed, and he summoned ‘⁴ prelates exempt
and non-exempt '' (that is, those who were not liable to
taxation, and those who were), and with them other ‘¹ fore-
seeing and mature men of great literature in the province '’
(homines magnae literaturae). So sudden and desperate
an emergency required a strengthened Convocation.
ln 1414 this body was summoned to meet in November,
with a view to sending ambassadors to the Council of
Constance. The sum voted for their support took the
form of atax on all liable benetices of 4d. in the pound,
and on non-taxed benefices sometimes as much as 8d.
in the mark ; this, however, was to be laid in accordance
with ‚the true value of such untaxed benefices, and
should be estimated ‘¹ iuxta discretionem vestram.’'
Two months later Convocation again met, and, with
deep grumblings, voted two whole tenths.
