allocution which answers to the King's speech in Parlia·
ment. ln this he can explain business to be undertaken,
and refer to deaths and important incidents (4) He
has a veto on all Acts of Convocation ε “ No resolution,’'
Trevor says ‘¹ even of both Houses, can take effect without
his concurrence.’' (5) ln the early days he had also the
right of drawing up Constitutions, which, before being
promulgated, were laid before Convocation, and gained
more authority by their approval. Finally‚ (6) he could
dissolve Convocation, as we see in the Mandate oi 1384*

Asa rule, Convocation was summoned to meet at
the same time with Parliament, though the older docu-
ments show no close connexion between the two bodies,
On the other hand, it hasbeen stated that Convocation
could not be summoned, adjoumed, or dissolved‚ save by
the corresponding action in Parliament. This was usually

true. Still, there are several instances oi occasions in
which Convocation did not run even with Parliament.
Thus in 1297, Convocation sat on the 26th March,
Edward being then iu Scotland. The King did not hold
his Parliament till he had reached Berwiek-on-Tweed, at
the end of the summer ; and then, later still, he convoked
it ior Bury St. Edmund's on the 3rd November. In 1316
a royal writ called the churchmen to meet “post quin-
denam Paschatis,'’ while Parliament was summoned 10

“ ln this year Courtenay, Archbishop oi Canterbury, addressed
a letter to the Bishops of London and winchester to the following
effect: that a Convocation having replied to a request for a subsidy by
saying that “propter sufficientes et ratiocinabiles causas non possunt
hac vicedomino nostro regi de aliquo subvenire subsidio,'' he, feeling
that Convocation had as a prime duty to vote money 10 the liing,
and being also unwilling that his clergy should any longer be burdened
with serving and delay, gives orders ‘⁸ quatenus Convocationem eandem
eadem auctoritate praedicta dissolvatis omnino, et clerum praedictum
ab omni exactione liberum penitus dimittatis ’' (Wilkins, Concilio, Ill,
187). Α similar power, no doubt, resided also in the Archbishop 01

York.
