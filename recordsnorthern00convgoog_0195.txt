' they can, We are on onr way towards the parts of the ‚

North, where it is of high inrportance for Us to have
abundance of what we need for the carrying out of our
affairs, And the prelates and clergy of the Province of
Canterbury have promised Us an aid suitable for this
joumey; the success of this our said affair touches you
far more closely than those of the clergy of the aforesaid
Province. Wherefore you [should] with a specially good
beart, as we [hope], and with all the speed possible [at
once] assemble the elergy of the Province of York to meet
you at York on a frxed day wrthin a fortnight after the
’ date of this Writ: and that you should begin to make
Us some suitable aid, such as may be to the honour and
profit of both Us and you, and all Our people, and to the
confusion of Our aforesaid foes: considering this, that the
success of this our affair touches you more nearly than it
does the other Provinee, seeing that our foes are far
nearer to you. Given under Our privy seal at York the
11th day of October, in the tenth year of our reign (1316).
