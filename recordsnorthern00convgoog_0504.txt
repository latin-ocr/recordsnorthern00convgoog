- War, yet one which placed in the hands oi Llewelyn ap
Griffith as Prince oi Wales practically the whole of
modern Wales save the lands in the extreme south and
south-west, subject, however, to the recognition of the ⁴
English king as overlord and the payment ol an indemnity

customs ol the nativos and the establishment ol English
trading communities, both protected by English castles
and garrisons. Hence the rising ol 1282, wider and more
national in scope than any previous movement, and only
