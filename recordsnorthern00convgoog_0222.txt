Nonrnenx Cosvocnrrou. 95

xlvii. The Constitutions ol Archbishop Thoresby,
which were passed by one Convocation and afterwards
amended in another, were issued by him trorn Thorp.
(Bishopthorpe) on the 30th September, 1367.

The Constitutions ol Archbishop John Thoresby were
not in any sense the act ol Convocati0n‚ though they were
certainly read in Convocation and discussed. They deal
with that well-known evil, the abuse ol markets 0r lairs,
with shows, and with unseemly sports on vigils and at
the time ol funeral ceremonies. They regulate the synodal
constitutions ; arrange lor the salaries ol chaplains. Thence
they pass to the carelessness ol mothers or nurses, who
olten overlay babes; and the Archbishop lorbids father,
mother, nurse, or anyone, to sleep with an infant, who
should have his own cradle to himself. They then deal
with tithe, alienations, and the dress manners and
respectability ot all clerics. The clergy were apparently
still tempted to put on unseemly clothes : ‘⁶ vestes delerant
nimia brevitate ridiculosas vel notandas ; nec in calciamentis
quaerant gloriam vel decorem, sed iu statu mentis et habitu
corporis Deo et homiuibus studeant complacere .....
Nonnulli tamen et clerici in sacris ordinibus et sacerdotio
constituti, propriae dignitatis immemores et officii, ac
ordinis clericalis honorem temere prosequentes, contra
sacras constitutiones et poenas in eisdem ordinatas, vestes
publice deferre presumpserint deformiter decurtatas,

, mediam tibiarum suarum seu genua nullatenus attingentes
ac contra decentiam et clericalis suae sacerdotalis ordinis
honestatem, ad jactantiam et suorum corporum ostenta·
tionem et morum dissolutionem, absque rationabili causa
et honesta sic deterre, et eis uti publice et communiter
indies non desistunt in animarum suarum periculum,
ordinis clericalis et ecclesiae Dei grave scandalum,
aliorumque Christi fidelium exemplum perniciosum.’' The
Constitutions pass thence to cases ol marriage and divorce,
and ol secret. marriages. The Archbishop, finally, orders
the Constitutions to be published‚ and that Rectors and
Vicars have copies ot them. And he informs us that the
Statute was modified in the Provincia] Council, so as to
lessen the chances ol excommuncation lor careless priests.
Last of all, he reserves thirty-seven cases to his own
