> ΙΙ. The “Acta ’' contain but little, and ior the
period covered by my examination oi the Registers there
is nothing, as they are later in date.

ΙΙΙ. And the “ bundles ” 01 documents are oi later
date still, commencing in the seventeenth century.

The Processes against the Order of the Templars
might be omitted except the first, which uias in Convoca-
tion. But a very interesting and attractive Appendix
might be formed by including various miscellaneous
documents connected with Church History. The
Order oi Coronation, and ior Burial oi a King; Services
appointed ior certain dayS, and orders instituting
observance oi certain festivals; Order forbidding the
veneration of Henry VI at York; Certificate conceming
a converted Jew in 1318 (in vol. ix). And certain
proceedings in cases oi sorcery and heresy.

The “ totus clerus ’' who are summoned to Convoca-
· tion are not fully defined in a way applicable to modern
changed conditions. In writs issued by the Kings ior
military arrays the “totus clerus '' who are to be
summoned to provide aid are said to include, with others,
‘⁴ rectores, vicarios, ac ceteros quocunque nomine cen-
seantur,’' and the same words are used in a Convocation
citation in 1349 with reference to all ecclesiastical persons
whatsoever, both regulars and seculars But in 1627 the
⁴⁴ clerus '' are those “qui ab antiquo vocari seu moneri
solebant,’' and in 1640 the Archdeacon oi Nottingham
certihes that he has cited all who hold any benefice or
ecclesiastical promotion. And it seems most probable
that the narrower interpretation is that which, without
any direct legal authority, has prevailed since the

Reiomration.
