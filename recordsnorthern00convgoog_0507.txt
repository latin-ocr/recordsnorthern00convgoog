was the heir. But there was at least some reason ior
thinking that neamess to the source should determine
the claim, in which case Robert Bruce, lord 01 Αο00011010,
Balliol’s maternal uncle, might be held 1011ον0 a better
right. Or, again, the monarchy might be treated as
1001101 estate, in which case the rights 01 John 01 Hastings,
lord 01 Abergavenny, as representing the third daughter

When one reflects what advantages might have
accrued 10 England from the division oi Scotland into
three 010103, 11 is not a little to the credit 01 Edward that
he rejected that solution. His attitude was eminently
impartial, the judges he appointed representative 01 1110

Balliol was impossible 11010 1110 first. Edward had,
indeed, preserved the unity 01 800110011, 1101 only on
condition that Scotland should accustom 113011 10 1110
supremacy 01 England. Suits were regularly carried
from Scotch courts to Westminster‚ nor was King John
strong enough to offer any resistance to his master in
England. But the Seots barons were not disposed to
