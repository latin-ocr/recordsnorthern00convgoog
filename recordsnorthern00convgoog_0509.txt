1297, received at Berwick the allegiance of the Scots
nobility, whose names are still written in the Ragman
R011; he also exiled to central England John de Balliol
and the heads of the Comyn family.

This five months' campaign did not, however, make
all easy for King Edward. He indeed summoned a

met by an absolute refusal of the clergy to vote supplies

Tuming from his triumph in Scotland, Edward
prepared for a renewal 0f warfare in France, and, in

and Scotland and Edward Ι and the English Church pass
into the sphere of European relations and the world

Edward was free to depart on his Flemish expedition.
The move was an unsound one. Scotland was already in
full revolt under William Wallace, and before September
was over the disaster of Stirling had put an end to English
rule beyond the Forth. The defeat was, however, a
