Nonnunnu Couvocarrou 127

This was an open violation oI the compact already agreed
on for the healing of the hreach3 and his Cardinals after
iu vain resisting and protesting, seceded from Lucca to
Pisa, where they issued an appeal for a General Council.
This was the beginning of the end of the Schism. The
Mandate of the Archbishop‚ which follows here, dated

’ 7th July, 1408, was addressed to Thomas Langley, Bishop
of Durham. Archbishop Henry' Bowet, who had been
consecrated to York the year before, was deeply interested
fn the Schism problem‚ and wanted to heal the breach.
For iu his earlier life he had been a chaplain to Urban VI
at Rome, and, in the days of confusion that followed,
very narrowly escaped execution. Hc was sentenced to
die, and was saved only by pleading his “ clergy ’' from
ending his career under the executioner’s hands. From
this mandate of his we see how keenly he watched the
fortunes of the fray. He also (in 1400) was represented
by a Proctor at the Pisa Council. Meanwhile, as Pope or
Antipope, Benedict held his Conncil at Perpignan‚ with
only nine Cardinals around him. Gregory had been
deserted by his eight (or, as Archbishop Bowet says, by
ninel Cardiuals. And now no hope of peace between
the factions seemed possible. It was left for the College
of Cardinals to repudiate both combatant PopeS,
and they did it with singularly strong language.; they also
met to arrange for the summoning of a Council. This they
accomplished at Ieghorn, where benedict’s four Cardinals
and the eight, or nine, who had left Gregory at Lucca,
undertook‚ without the sanction of any Pope or Emperor,
to call a Council to be held at Pisa.
