Nonrnunv Convocarrou. 40

Archbishop had the right to summon, and not to a Con-
vocation called on a Royal Writ. It will be seen that there
is no statement that it is to be summoned at the King's
command ; only that it is called in obedience to a commission
from the Pope. ln this Synod or Convocation a letter,
dated 2nd June, 1311, was addressed to Edward 11.*

lt is probable that the Constitutions of Archbishop
Grenefeld, dated 16th July, 1311, were considered at this
assembly. lt is also probable that a separate Writ was
issued to the Bishop of Durham. Antony Bel( had lately
died, and his successor, Richard Kellaw‚ was not con-
secrated when this Writ was issued at the end of May.
Kellaw was consecrated the day before this Writ appeared ;
and the consecrating bishopS, the Archbishop of York, the
Bishops of Carlisle and Whithom‚ must have been on the
spot to receive the summons.

This letter is printed chiefly as it shows the indepen-
dence of this early Convocation in the matter of taxation.
