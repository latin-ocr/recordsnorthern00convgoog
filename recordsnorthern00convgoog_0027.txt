ture sule. the taxing authority of the Papacy over the
saurituality would be acquiesced in, while, on the other
haud. the Bishops would be found glad to influence,
trinu to compel, their beneficed clergy to give aids to the
liiug on the Pope’s authority. Here, however, it soon
luuzuue clear that Rome had overshot the mark. N either
bishops nor clergy looked with favour on such foreign
interference; they resented the introduction of a new and
independeut authority in the matter of “raising money
for the royal needs. They saw in it an underlying claim
on the. part of the Pope for a supreme lordship over all
ecelesiastical territories in England.

Edward I, of all men, was the least likely to acquiesce
iu such a claim. He scented at once the evil odour which
would arise from such grants. And so we hear that the
papal legate was countered at once by the direct inter-
vention of the royal power. The King knew how to
euforce his authority. He put, at once, strong pressure
uu liis clergy, and even went so far as to outlaw such
bishops as resisted, seizing their possessions into his own
nands. ns lie had given, so would he resume. This
practica} measure brought repentance; bread and water
are persuasive preachers. The bishops and clergy capitu-
latum and Edward carne triumphant out of the struggle.
'l'lwrn without hesitation, as a wisc statesman, he set
asido ull thought of ‘¹ resolute government,‘' that snare of
uwak tyranny, aud followed the better way. He would
never advance, as many a weak tyrant still tries to
iulvauce, hy trampling on the existing ill-feeling with a
violent luel. His should be the way of peace, a plan
wlwreby the general goodwill and consent of his people
should happily be won. ln other words he then brought
into action the new principle of Representation.
