There exists a little picture of a dead meeting of the
Southern Convocation at a sornewhat later date. Un-

The Rev. E. Nares (afterwards Professor of History at
Oxford) was elected a Proctor in 1812, and tried to arouse
some interest in Convocation. Manners Sutton‚ then
Archbishop of tanterbury, met his advances with a
chilling politcness, and declined to present Mr. Nares on
his appointrnent. ln spite of this rebuff, Mr. Nares
presented himself at St. Paul’s, and has left us a sketch oi
the proceedings. “The whole business appeared to me

Lower House as were present were left to find their places
as best they could, and not in robes. Audon retiring to
choose a Prolocutor, scarcely twenty were present, most

ceeding. The irnpression left upon my mind ivas that
the Lower House iras shorn of all dignhy, and its members

the Primatc and the llislrops.'’*

After this long sleep, Convocation was awakened in
1852, when the revived churchmanship of the time, led
by Bishop Samuel Willierforce, appealed to the (lovern-
