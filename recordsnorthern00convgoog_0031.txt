in a like summons for the Canterbury Synod in 1281.
In 1279 York had, in connexion with the statute “De
Religiosis,’' voted by the clergy certain subsidies to the
Crowu, and the King had recognized some representation.
lt may have come in earlier; this, however, seems to be
the first formal official notice of it.

lt appears, then, that the first clear and distinct
appearance oi representation takes place in 1283, when,
lor the Canterbury province proctors were summoned to
a Parliament at Northampton, while the proctors ior the
York province were summoned to meet at York itself.*
The King had lately been at Rhuddlan, in North Wales,
a village between St. Asaph’s and the sea. He could not
summon his clergy to meet him at so great a distance
from home, and so he planned that they should meet .
respectively at Nottingham and at York. The northern
summons sent out at this tirne is specially interesting, as
it shows that the brilliant Antony Bek, at the time
Archdeacon ol Durham, was already felt to be a power
in the north. He was soon to be appointed Bishop oi

Durham, ln this assembly of 1282-3, the Canterbury ’
clergy, when called on to vote an aid. excused themselves
on the remarkable plea that the parochial clergy were not

parliamentary and constitutione] representation being

summoned proctors lor the beneficed clergy.†
