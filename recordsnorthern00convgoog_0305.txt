that is, 101 all who aiter the passing 01 the enactment
might still sue in foreign Courts in any matter cognizable
by the King’s Bench. This was “ one 01 the strongest
delensive measures taken in consequence ol the conduct
01 the Pope, who had forbidden the bishops to execute
the sentences 01 the royal Courts in suits connected with
patronage.’' The prelatos protested warmly against the
Law 01 Provisors (1351) and continued in protest against
like measures delending the kingly right against foreign
intervention. The name 01 this statute is taken 110111 the
opening words 01 the Writ which charges the Sheriff to
summon the delinquent to Court. A stronger statute, 01
similar tenure, was passed in 1393 by Parliament‚ in spite
01 incessant protests lrorn the Churchmen. The Clergy
in the North stubbomly maintained this temper, and
showed an anti-national spirit; they treated the papal
claims as the voice 01 God, and had little sympathy with
the royal claim. We also see, later on, the same temper
01 mind in the Protest so tearlessly issued by Cuthbert
Tunstall‚ Bishop 01 Durham. The document here given
was drawn up by Archbishop Stafiord in 1447, and was
adopted also by the Northem Convocation.
