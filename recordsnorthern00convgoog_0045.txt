xxiv quFAcE.

Durham wrote, not to the Archdeacon, but to the Dean
ol Christianity, bidding him summon thc clergy to elect
their proctors in St. Nicholas' Chureh in Durham.

The usageS, rights, and duties ol a Convocation can
easily be traced as carried out by this regular system ol
delegation. ln the ‘⁴ Modus tenendi parliamentum,''
als0, a document which Bishop Stnbbs calls “a fairly
credible account ot the state ol Parliaments under Edward
Il‚'’ there'is an exact account ol the way ol summoning.
“The King was also wont to issue his summons to Arch-
bishops, Bishops and hobus, to Priors DcanS, and other
ecclesiastical personages having separate jurisdictions
through exemptions and privileges ol the kind, that, by
each deancry and archdcaconry ol England they should
cause to be elected two learned and proper proctorS,
each from their own Archdeaconry, to come and take
part in the Parliament, and that these should undertake,
allege, and do, whatsoever all -and each ol such deaneries
and archdeaconrics could wish to have done had they
all been present personally. These proctors should come
with their warrants in duplicate scaled with the scal ol
their superiors.''* ln addition to this interesting in-
struction, wc also sind that “illis (ie, the members so
summoned) tenetur Rex ministrare sumptus et expensas
suas de veniendo et morando ad Parliamentum.’' This
passage ol course refers to a Parliamcntary summons, lor
elergy and laity alikc ; it applics just as well to Convoca-
tion.

How proctors were elected to Convocation is not
stated; in all probability by an open vote taken in the
main town ot the Archdeaconry. The example ol 1396
confirms this, for St. Nicholas' Church was the chiel city
