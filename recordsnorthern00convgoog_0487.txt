inscriptions, in churches. Thus he occupied the position
ol a modern Chancellor, with his laculties. ln some
parts he had to collect lunds, as we have seen under
Bishop Suffield in 1254; he had also charge ol Church
labrics. At Bruges the licenses to preach or hear con-
tessions had to be exhibited before him, and he had the
usual care ol morals A synod ol Bruges in 1571 laid
down his special duties‚ under the title ol ‘⁴ De diversis
decanorum Christianitatis officiis.’' He could grant
dispensations to millers and brewers lor working on
Sundays and holidays. At Sens, at an earlier date,
1415, he had the following remarkable duty :—“ Clerici
ribaldi ..... maxime qui dicuntur de Familia Goliae
. . . per Decanum Christianitatis tonderi praecipiantur vel
etiam radi,'’ lest these bulioons should be taken lor duly
tonsured clerks. Thc ‘⁴ familia Goliae ” is a name ol
quite uncertain origin, given to those ‘⁴ gaillards,'‘ or
merry rascals, who wandered about the world, perhaps
gypsieS, amusing the idle public with coarse jests and
bufloonery. lt has been suggested that the name comes
irom the big rough lellow Goliath, sometimes a character
in miracle plays. The origin ol the word is quite
uncertain.

At Antwerp these Decani had quite unusual duties,
arising from the lact that the city was a port ol cntry.
“ Decani Christianitatis administrabunt sacramenta
sacerdotibus externis . . . aut exequias,'’ and every
midwile had to appear belore him to be examined touching
her raith, so watching ofl heresy from the first beginnings
oi life (ab. 1610). He had also to check usury : at synods
he should appear in alb and stole, while the common
priest came in a surplice only. At an early time this
decanus had charge ol the “cura lori poenitentialis.’'
He seems to have invaded, in Henry lll's days, the

Courts Christian, presiding therein ; here, however, the lay
power resisted, and he lailed to secure his rule in these
Courts (Dansey, Il, 102).
