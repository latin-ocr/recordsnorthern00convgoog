APPENDIX. cv

Two cases have been met with of discussion by the
Lower House separately. When the Upper House
consisted of only the Archbishop and two Bishops (after
the see of Candida Casa ceased to belong to the province),
and the Arehbishop himself frequently acted by com-
mission, it may be presumed that usually the Houses sat
together. But in 1426, when in protracted debate the
clergy sturdily were refusing a subsidy and pleading
that they must go home to gather in their harvest, they
were twice desired by the Bishop of Durham and his
fellow-commissaries to retire “ seorsim '' for consideration.
And twice they did rethe, but brought back their former
answer. The Prolocutor is here first found mentioned,
under the name of Referendary, as a customary officer
through whom by vvord of mouth, not by writing, answers
were given to the President; a method which, again,
would imply that separation, if not customary, was at
least sometimes practised. The second instance met with
is in 1545, when the Lower House debated “seorsim '¹
upon a subsidy.

With reference to points of form and order, the

printing of some writs and citations in different centuries;
as specimens, or at least the copying of some in order to
ascertain what variations may have been made, is
desirable. ln the days which l was able to give to the
actual examinatior] of the ‘large volumes of Registers
from 1276 to 1545, it uras not possible to engage in any
definite comparison of the kind.
