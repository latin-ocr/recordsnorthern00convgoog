Londoniensis vel alibi, etc.'’* And the book oi the Acta
comes toan abrupt close in the middle ot a page, and in
the middle oi a sentence, the entry being dated 30th
August, 1678. The last words oi it are “Quibus die et
loco . . . ,'' with which this second volume closes, leaving
some blank pages The third volume is ol a different
lorrn, long and thin; and on the lirst page oi it we lind
the same form oi words still used at the opening oi a
Convocation: “All and singular persons admonished to
appeare this day, honre, and place, at the present Con-
vocation make your appearance, land answer to your
names as you shall be called] upon paine oi Law. God

save the king, Queeu, and his Gracc the Lord Arehbishop
ot Yorke.’'

In the troubled moment between James II and
William and Mary, we gather from the York Records

that Convocation met without a Royal Writ. They
appear to have done nothing.† ’

111 1689 the Dean oi York nominated tour proetors,
the Archdeacon oi York two; and in these years the
usual Proclamation, which pronounced absentees to be
contumacious etc, was signed by John (Sharp), Arch-
bishop oi York. It may be gathered irom the mark ῥεῖν
(personaliter) written against certain names, that out ol
the long list oi members only about irom iour to six
actually appeared, and these came solely to hear the
King's Writ and the Archbishop's Mandate and the
Proclamation, and, finally, the prorogation.
