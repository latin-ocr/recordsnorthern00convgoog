ad nostram doctrinam scripta sunt.’' And by that
learning, we ought to apply and draw words to the truth,
and so to understand them, as they may signifie truth,
and not so to wrest them, as they should maintain a lie.
For otherwise, as Hereticks have done with the Holy
Scripture, so shall all men do with familiar speech ; and
if all things shall be brought into familiar disputation,
he that shall call us “ Supremum et unicum Dominum‚'’
by that means, and as goeth your argument, might be '
reproved: For Christ is indeed “ unicus Dominus et
Supremos,’' as we confess him in the church daily: and
now it is in opinion, that ‘¹ Sancti '' be not mediators;
the contrary whereof ye affirm in your letters, because
of the text 01 S. Paul, ‘⁴ Unus est mediator inter Deum
et hominem.'’ And after that manner of reason which
ye use in the entry, if any man should say, This land is
my own, and none hath right in it but 1; he might be
reproved by the Psalm “Domini est terra.” For why
should a man call “terram aliquam '’ onely his, whereof
God is the chief Lord and Owner? Why is it admitted
in familiar speech to call a man dead, of whom the soul,
which is the chief and best part, yet liveth? How is it
that we say, this man or that man to be a founder of this
church, seeing that in one respect God is only founder?
We say lilrewise, that he is a good man to the church, a
special benefactor of the church; and that the church is
fallen down, when the stones he fallen down, the people
preserved and liveing; and in all this manner 01 speech,
when we hear them, it is not accustomed nor used 10 do
as yc do, that is to say, to draw the word “ Church ''
to that sense, wherein the speech may be a lie, but to
take it in that wherein it signifieth truth. Which
accustomed manner 11 ye had followed, ye should not
have needed to have laboured- so much in the declaration
01 thc word “ Ecclesia,'' in that signification wherein it is
most rarely taken, and cannot, without maintenance 01
100 manifest a lie, to be applied to any man. For,
taking “ Ecclesia’' in that sence ye take it, S. Paul
