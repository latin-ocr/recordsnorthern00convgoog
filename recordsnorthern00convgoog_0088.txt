accordingly, took seat as head in the assembly, and by
menaces and fraud induced the elergy to oller ξ 100‚000,
on condition ol receiving a full pardon. To their con-
sternation Henry refused the oller, unless they coupled
with it the recognition of his title ol Supremo Head ol
the Church ol England. The Southern Convocation
spent three days discussing this, and in the end hoped to
get out ol it by a kind ol compromise: they ceded the
title, but added to it the words ⁴‘ quantum per Christi
legem liceat,” so easing their consciences The King hit
out with contemptuous scorn : “ let me have the business
passed, without any quantums or tantums’'*

To this Fuller adds that “since this year, lrom
Archbishop Cranmer to Archbishop Laud, all Convoca-
tionS, so long as they lasted, are born tongue-tied, till
the King did cut the string thereos with his letters patent,

allowing thern leave to debate on matters ol religion.
Otherwise, what they conclude are arrows without piles,
daggers without points, too blunt to pierce into the
practice ol others, but sharp enough to wound themselves
and bring them within the compass ol a praemunire.”†

It will be well to note the successive moves ol the
royal power. In 24th Henry VIII, c. 12, the lirst Statute
ol Appeals determined that all causes, secular or spiritual,
should be determined at horne, none being thencelorth
to be sent over to the Papal Curia ; then, carrying on the
autocratic power ol the Crown‚ the petition ol the
Commons House in 25th Henry VIII alleged that the
Acts of the elergy in Convocation interiered with the
rights ol the King, and ol his subjeets. This petition was
sent down to Convocation. In the end they gave way.
