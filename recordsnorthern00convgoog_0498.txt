374 Reconns or rins

On rire See or Sooon nno Min.

⁴ This paper is largely taken from the Registrum Sacrum
Anglicanum oi Bishop stubbs, supplemented by help
kindly given me by the Rev. G. H. Godwin, Mn.

Bishop Stubbs makes preface to his list by warning
us that “a perfect list of these bishops is still a desidera-
tum.'’ “The common lists,'' he says, ‘⁴ contain many
names which ought not to be there,'' and he adds that
his own list is drawn out from the series given at the end
of the Manx Chronicle‚ which runs to 1374.

The history of this see is complicated by the question
ot jurisdiction, as between the Archbishop of Nidaros
(Trondhjem) in Norway, the Archbishop of Glasgow, and
the see of York. The very name of the see is often
changed, and ior a long time there were two sees, one
oi the ‘⁴ Southem Island5,'’ under Glasgow, and the other
of Man, under Nidaros

It is also interesting to note that the right of
nominating to the see is in different hands at various
periods of the history oi the see.

Though other names are given, our historic knowledge
at present runs no sarther back than to the beginning of
the twelith century, when Wimnnd‚ or humond, MacAulay
was created bishop.
