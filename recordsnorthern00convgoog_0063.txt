Thus, in 1323·4 the two Convocations sat, because oi the
unwillingness ol the clergy to help Edward in his ex-
pedition into Scotland. They mistrusted him. It was
already an understood trick‚ that the King should ask for
an aid toran expedition, and then use the money con-
tributed on his own weak vices; it was a not unusual
lorm oi getting money on false pretences. In January,
1324, Convocation replied that the clergy were very poor,
and begged to be excused from voting a subsidy. At the
same time they generously promised, ii they were let off
money payment, to be profuse in saying masses and
making prayers ior the King and ior the success oi his
proposed expedition. The royal reply we do not know
though we have an earlier example in the case of Henry
111.* lt may be that one result, a wholesome consequence,
was that belore this reply was received Edward II had
made a truce for thirteen years with Robert Bruce, so
that this disastrous war, cause oi boundless waste and
misery ior twenty-three years, had actually ended before
Convocation sent this quaint reply to the King. A little
later, in 1327, Edward III summoned Convocation to
meet at lincoln, where he proposed to hold a Parliament ·
at the same time. Only a few members ol the Northem
House appeared, and they came simply to protest that
their synod, being provincial, could not be held outside
the Northem Province. The Archbishop oi York felt

ln the Council oi London, 12 5 ς, we are told that “when Magister
Rustandus had made them a sufficiently prolix speech, and had
demanded ‘ad opus papae et ad opus regia, juvamen pecuniae non
modicum,' the eistercians refused the aid. T hen King Henry sent ior
the Abbot ot Buildwas‚ who made him the reply that ‘it was more
seemly to ask them ior ¹ orationes magis quam pecuniam‚' and that the.
King might surely be satisfied with these, as the King oi France‚ pious
man, had been with churchmen’s prayers.' To this Henry rejoined,
with a practica} ii pious mind, that: Ἰ should be grateful ior
prayers,-but l must have the money too.' ’'
