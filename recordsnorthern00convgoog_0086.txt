was, lor Durham‚ Tunstall's bold protest against the
historic title oi “ Supremum caput ecclesiae Anglicanae.''
ln this same Convocation Tunstall also read a strongly-
worded protest against a summons sent by the Dean
and Chapter ol York at the time of the vacancy caused
in the Archbishopric by Wolsey's death. The assumption
hythe King of headship over the Church as well as over the
State, asserting a right never hitherto insisted on, or, il ⁴
it ever had been acted on, had fallen completely out ol use,
was now emphasized by the appointment of Thomas
Cromwell as Vicar General. This creation took rank above
either Archbishop. This “had no precedent, and was

never repeated.’' The Church submitted perforce, but did ⁶
not acquiesce “in this startling fact that the authority
claimed by and wrested lorcibly from that foreign
poteritate the Pope, was not transferred to the English
Church as such, orto the Parliament, but to the person
ol the King himsell.’' From this time Convocation had
no real duty save that of voting subsidies* The
Statute ol Royal Supremacy issued in 1534 “ may be said
to have completed the work of separation of the English
Church irorn the Roman obedience.'' In that year the
Canterbury Convocation took a vote on the claims ol the
Papacy. Thirty-four members declared that those claims
were unfounded. One voter stood alool and did not
vote; and lour voted for the Papal supremacy. In
York the same question was settled in the same way

without a dissentient voice.

Changes now moved apace. Henry’s masteriul
resistance against the Papal claims encouraged all who

had discemed that more was at stake than a mere struggle
between national and imperial ideas ol statesmanship.
