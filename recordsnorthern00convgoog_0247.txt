lxix. ln 1397 Rohert Waldhy was¹ translated lrorn
'chichester to York, and held the Archiepiscopal see tor a
very short time; he died oth January, 1398. It seems,
therefore, that he had not been able to hold a Convocation
at all, and King Richard ΙΙ addresses the following letter to
the Archbishop who succeeded him, Richard le Scrope, who
was translated from Lichfield in 1398. This was the prelate
wh0‚ alter having taken part in the northern conspiracy ol
1405 against Henry 1V,* was taken prisoner when the
attempt had utterly failed, and was beheaded just outside
York, Bishop Stubbs calls it “a judicial murder'’; it
certainly was a tragedy never foreseen by English law, nor
was he condemned by any true legal court. The unlor·
tunate Archbishop lived ior some time in popular esteem.
We are told by Hardyng that Henry gave licence l'or offerings
to be made at Scrope's tomb in York llinster; ior, as
Shalrespeare put it, he did “consecrate commotion's bitter
edge ’' (Henry 1 V, iv, 1). ‘⁸ The execution ol an Archbishop
was an event lor which English history offered no paralleli
Scrope was ‘a most popular prelate, a member ol a great
Yorlrshire house.' To lay hands on such a man might seem
a rash‚ a desperate act; yet the King’s throne was not
shaken hy it. 'she Papal anathemas iell unheeded to the
ground. 'l'he people might worship at Scrope's lomb, as at
the shrine ol a ma1·tyr; they might ascribe miracles to l1is
body ; bnt no avenger ever ventured to draw sword in the
cause ol the lost A1·clrbislrop.'’†
