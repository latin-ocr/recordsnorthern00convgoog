At a later date, 1409, Convocation was again lar
from being “ buxom ” with subsidies. There were
alleged reasonable excuses ; they hung back till December.
ln fact, the fifteenth century began badly in the matter
of churchtaxation. Henry lV was unpopular in the
North. ln the border districts all lelt that they had
suffered enough from Scottish saida without also having
to pay taxes to keep up armies which did nothing to
protect them. The feeling was prevalent all through the
century. At this period the amount ol a tenth appears
to have been about {14500 lor the Seuthem Province,
while, tor the Northem, it was barely a tenth oi that
amount. According to the original “ taxatio,'' it was
calculated to reach {4000 in that province, though it
hardly reached {1400 in actual payment. The returns
from the days oi chry lV were still worse. They reach
lor Canterbury to {11,000, and for York amount only to a
poor [600. About 1415 the tax brought in rather more:
Canterbury's return came to nearly [12900. and l'ork's
to about {1,250.* ln 1411 the clergy could not be
persuaded to vote an aid at all. They had met at
Beverley, and were adjoumed thence to Bishopthorpe,
hard by York. The Archbishop‚ in his letter tn the
King‚ tells us that “as the clergy at Beverley would not
