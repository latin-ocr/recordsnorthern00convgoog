236 Reconns or rna

To the second, we think the King's Highnoes, ne any
temporat man may not be Supreme Head oi the Church
by the lawes oi God, to have or exercise any jurisdiction
or power spiritual in the same. And all acts oi Parliament
made to the contrary to be revoked.

To the third we say, we be not sufficiently instructed
in the fact, ne in the process therein made ; but we refer

it to the determination oi the Church, to whom it is
upheld.

To the fourth we think, that no clerk ought to be

put to death without degradation by the lawes of the
Church. ’

Το the fifth we think that no man ought be drawn
out of sanctuary, but in certain cases expressed in the
lawes oi the Church.

To the sixth we say, that the clergy of the North
parts hath not granted nor consented to the parliament

oi the tenths or tirstfruits oi the benefices, in the
Convocation. And also we can make no such personal
graunt by the iawes of the Church. And we think that
no temporal man hath authority by the laws of God
to claim any such tenths or firstiruits oi any benefice
or spiritual promotion.

To the seventh we think, that lands given to God,
the Church, or religious men, may not be taken away
and put to profane useS, by the laws of God.

To the eigth we think, that Dispensations upon
just causes lawfully graunted by the Pope oi Rome, to
be good and to be accepted. And pardons have been
allowed by General Councils oi Lateran and Vienna, and
by laws of the Church.

To the ninth we think that by the law oi the Church,
general Councels, interpretatione of approved doctorS,
and consent of Christen people, the Pope of Rome hath
been taken ior the Head of the Church, and Vicar of
Christ, and so ought to be taken.
