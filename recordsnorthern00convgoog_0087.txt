Convocation, however, which could be bent, un-
willingly no doubt, to support the King's personal claims
oi authority, was lar more warmly synrpathetic with him
in his strong determination to support both the ancient
system ot Church govemment and the orthodox strictness
ot Church belief. Though the York Convocation had
twice written letters to him protesting against his action
with respect to the supremacy* Henry persevered with
true Tudor obstinacy, and in the end bent them to his
will. He knew his own mind, and saw, too, that in the
present ferment he need not tear resistance. Fuller gives
us a bright account ol Henry’s effective Statute (25 Henry
VIII, c. 19) :-“ That none ol the clergy should presumo
to attempt, allega, claim, or put in ure, any canons,
constitutions or ordinances provincial in their Convocation
in time coming which shall always be assembled by the
King's Writ, unless the same clergy may have the King's
most royal assent and license to make, promise and
execute such canons constitutions and ordinances,
provincial or synodal, upon pain oi every one oi the said
clergy doing contrary to this Act, and thereos convicted,
to suffer imprisonment and making line at the King’s
will.’'† This was Henry's reply to the two protestations
Fuller tells us how it went: ‘⁴ Wherein the King began
mildly to make the passage for his supremacy with their
conscienccs, by a rational and argumentative way . . . .
claiming nothing more thereby (ic, by the title oi

Supremo Head of the Church) than what Christian princes
iu the primitive times assumed to themselves in their

‹terminions.'' Henry gave instructions to Cromwell to be
present at and to manage the Convocations. Cromwell,
