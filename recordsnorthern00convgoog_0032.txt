- it lies in the rules laid down by Archbishop Peckhaz

“ Each bishop,’' says he, “shall about the aforesaid day
cause the clergy of his diocese to assemble, and shall have
careiully explained to them the propositions made on
behali ol the King‚ so that at the same time and place
in London, ior each diocese, two proctors shall corne in
the name of the clergy, and irom each Cathedral and
Collegiate Chapter shall come one proctor.” This was
made into a Canon. Thus one may say that this clerical
body at once and formally became, though the name was
not yet in use, the veritable Convocation ot the province

runs thus :-“ Ita quod ad dictos diem et locum Londiniis
de qualibet dioecesi duo procuratores nomine. cleri et de
singulis capitulis ecclesiarum cathedralium et collegia-
tarum singuli procuratores sufficienter instructi mittantur,
qui plenam et expressam potestatem habeant una
nobiscum et confratribus super praemissis tractandi et
consentiendi his quae ibidem ad honorem ecclesiae,
consolationem domini regis et pacem regni, cleri commu-
nitas providebit.'' It must be always remembered that,
as yet, the parliamentary representation of the clergy
is quite distinct irom the coming representation of
Convocation. Both, lor a time, go on together. ln the
Northem Provinee matters also moved in the same
direction about the same time.

ln 1279 Archbishop Wickwan summons his clergy,
through their Archdeacons to come together to vote a
subsidy. Each Archdeacon should come to Ponteiract
with two representatives oi his clergy, and irom the
beginning there seems to have been this marked difference
between the representative element in the North and that
in the South. We find that under Archbishop Giflard in

1271 the system oi two proetors from each Archdeaconry
