tanciful cause) first appears in Englaad* ·

ln a document issned by Archbishop courtenay in
1389 we find this name used as a word fully recognized
and accepted by the opponents ol Wyclitfe's teaching.
The Archhishop's phrase is “ Rogerum, Nicholaum,
Ricardum, Michaelem, Willelmum. caeterosque Lollardos,”
and again, at the end ot the paper,“ Emanavit Mandatum
contra lollardos in hac torma.'’

While Canterbury was thus torward in the chase,
Yorl( rather concentrated her attention on the resistance
against taxation. ln 1389 and 1392 it reluctantly voted
tenths, stipulating that they should be raised ‘⁴ secundum
novam taxam beneficiorum ej usdem provinciae‚'' and with
exception ol all monasteries, etc, “ which had been ruined
in the last Scots' invasion '¹ ; they also state that “they
grant this aid very unwillingly, lor they had been sore bur·
dened by bad harvests with Scottish raidS, together with
many other calls, unusually severe, all but insupportable.’'
ln the following year they granted only a halt-tenth,
with no conditions Another hall-tenth they offer on the
condition that the King himself should cross over into
either Scotland or lreland with a fighting force only;
and then they add that a third hali-tenth should be
paid ii the King went personally into France: “ but il
he did not go ahroad, to Scotland, lreland‚ or France
then the second and the third mediety should not be
raised at all.''†

⁹ “The name,'' says Dr. llurray, in the English Dictionory, s. a.
Lollard, '⁴ was originally applied, c. 1 yx), to the membcrs ol a branch
ot the Cellite or Alexian traterrrity (also called lulla-broedere). who
devoted themselves especially to the care ol the siclt, arul the providing
ol luneral rites lor the poor... .. lt usually was taken to connote great
protensione to picty and humility. combined with views more or less
hereticus*
