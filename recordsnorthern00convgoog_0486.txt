ior the Rural Deaneries‚ issued in 1550 by Archbishop
Rudolf of Cologne. Similarly in 1768 Bishop Francis
Warrans ot Ypres calls them his “ Decanos pastorum
pastores,'' and there is another torm ol the title and
office, at Briareo, where the Bishop reserves to himself
the power of creating “ Archidecani‚ qui pluribus regioni·
bus cum potestate pleniore praesint ” (Dansey, II, 277),
50, apparently, giving an “ Archdean ’' a still wider
position. The office appears to have been in lull force
and use throughout northern Christianity, and specially
in the days which Ranke aptly calls the time ol the
Counter-relormation in the time of the reaction carried
out so skillully by the Jesuits

The title occurs about 1574, at Tournay, Liege,
YpreS, Bruges, Malines, Ghent, Herzogenbusch. At
Ghent, in 1550, the title was rather Archipresbyter‚ and
Decanus Christianitatis is brought in only as an explana-
tory name. Thus Bishop Triest oi Ghent says
“ Mandamus et ordinamus ut pastores sacellani et bene·
ficiati quicunque Archipresbyteris suis, Christianitatis
Decanis‚ juxta juramentum, etc, tradant exactum speci-
ficationem bonorum (Dansey, ll, 254). ln France also
there was such a llean at Bayeux (1662), Besancon, Sens,
Afras, and litampcs, ‘⁴ les Doyens de la Chretiente ct
ruraux.'' ln (ierrnany, Archbishop Max of Cologne
uses thu. title in a lormal document: “Ego N. Decanus
Christianitatis’' ln England the title is widely distributed‚
though it does not oiten appear. We have it at
Canterbury and Yorlr. White Kennet tells us that “ the
Dcan ol Arches was ut first only the Urban Dean in
London, or the Dean of Christianity.” We find him also
in Durham, Leicester‚ Exeter, Worcester; in Rip0n‚ too
(liipon Chapter Acts, Sortees Soc, vol. 64, p. 47, note 2).
at Dublin the first Rural Dean was so designated; heis
first mentioned in 1214.

The chiel duties cntrustcd to him were to bless
books, to note the condition ol imageS, seats, epitaphs‚
