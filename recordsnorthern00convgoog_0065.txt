1352)* for 3 peace or truce between the two countries
This was in the first year of Zouche's pontificate, 1342,
or early in 1343, when Papal legates carne to England
to mediate a three years' truce. This fits in with the
statement in the King's writ, that the Archbishop would
do well to call a Convocation to sit at Pontefract, “ because,
as is said, you cannot conveniently enter your city of
York before the date fixed for your enthronement there.”
William de la Zouche was consecrated at Avignon in July‚
1342, by Clement himself. After the sitting of this
Convocation, Zouche forwards to the King a certificate
saying that “ after a great discussion and resistance, and
after many excuses for not voting an aid, the Convocation
yielded at last to the King’s prayer and the Archbishop’s
urgency, and voted a tenth‚'' only, however, on conditions
annexed, to the effect that the Church should enjoy all
libertieS, rights, and royal protecti0n; that churches and
ecclesiastics should be burdened with no vexations, wrongs,
or horse-keep for royal horses; that York should enjoy
all the favourable tenus laid down as conditions by
Canterbury; that if any other papal or royal subsidy
should be levied in the year, this should be reckoned as
having been pald as a part of the tenth voted to the
King; aisn, that damage done to the Church in the late
vacancy of the see of York should be put to rights ; that
in future, in time of vacancy, the care of the temporalities
should be placed in the hands of the Dean and Chapter,
that body paying to the Crown a certain sum for such time
of vacancyx also that this vote should be expended on
the protection and delence of the realm in the northern
parts, especially against the Scuta and in no otherwise

⁴⁵ 'luis was the Pope who made the remark that “ if the lfing of
England were to ask for an ass to be made Bishop we must not say hini
uay’' (Fures, Ch. Hist, ll., 297), a side evidence ol the strength
and persistence of Edward 111.
