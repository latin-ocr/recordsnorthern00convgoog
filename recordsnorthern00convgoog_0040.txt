from the end oi the thirteenth century to our orm ¹
day the character ol (onvocauon. as a constitutional
representative ol the English clergy. has never changed.
though, in lact, it mme to be reduced to a very thin ghost
in the eighteenth century. The clergi· were alicnis
oonvened by their proctors as ouners ol property. lhey
met not so much lor the spiritual weliare ol the (Thurch
as lor the general good and protection ol the nation. At
the outset‚ the clergy attached themselves rather to the
patriot and national side than to the party ol foreign mle
and influence. From the beginning it iias a kind ol
pmtest against the legatine authority exereised for the
Papacy. Though at first the orderly mind ol Eduard I
leaned towards making the clergy a third estate of the
realm, the estate ol the earls and barons being the first,
aud the estate of the burgage tenants. oi the men paying
'‘ knights' service,'' and other socage tenants who were
represented by proctors, being the second estate; still
he found in practice that his scheme was quite hopelessly
complicated by the double position oi the bishops and
abbots. This, and the dislike of the clergy to taxati0n‚
made him abandon his scheme ol estates, while he still
held to the constitution he had made for his clergy.
Thns he tell back on his two estates ol Parliament, and
made Convocation into a distinct body, an echo and pale
copy ol parliamentary independence.

Thus it came about that the English Convocation
diflered from all other synods ol clergy in the world.
