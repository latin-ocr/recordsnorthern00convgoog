- We have not much intorrnation about the Dean oi
Christianity at York. What is known has been mainly
collected by the Rev. T. Solloway‚ Rector oi Holy Trinity,
York, lor whose help and benefit oi knowledge I owe
warm thanks. In Domesday the district to the West oi
the City was called Christ Church; “later on it was
known as Christianity‚ now it is called Ainsty.” lt is
not known when it was first so called, or when it ceased
to be styled the Deanery oi Christianity-indeed the title
still appears in the York Diocesan Calendar. Mr.
Solloway suggests that the word Christianity osten being
contracted to “ Xtianity‚'' the central Dean came in the
end to be styled the Dean of Ainsty. Documentary
evidence seems to point another way, lor in a document
ot Richard Ι (1190) we find that the men of the
Wapentake “ de Heynsti '’ are quit of all forest burdens;
this form oi the word, coming so early, is quite against
- the contractiori theory irorn Christianity to Xtianity, and
thence to Ainsty. Anyhow this Ainsty‚ which still gives
the name to the Rural Deanery, was closely connected
with York city. In one place in a list ol the Diocesan
Rural Deaneries we find the first position given to “ The
Deanery ol Ainsty and York,” and that special Deanery
was the district under the Dean oi Christianity. This
Dean, as Ι have noticed already, was a man oi importance 1
he was entrusted with the indiction ol penalties on
clergy; and had custody ol the keys ol the dungeons
in York Castle, when the Templars lay there. The
present Holy Trinity Church at York was formerly
spoken oi as “Christ Church near the City.'' and
in the Chantry Survey Report the Churches ol York
are all grouped together as being under the supervision
ol the Dean ol Christianity.

Α very curious play on the phrase can be tound at
a much later time. Edward Brown speaking ot Dr.
Tillotson, then Dean oi Canterbury‚ says that he was
⁴‘ worthily to be called a ‘Dean oi Christianity,’ because
