Nonrrrann Convocarron 75

xxxi. ln 1334 Edward ΙΙΙ summoned the Convocation
ol the Province ol Canterbury to a Parliament to be holden
at York, on the Monday next belore the Fenst ol St. Peter
in Cathedra (22nd February, 1334). ln this summons he
introduces the ‘⁴ praemunientes ” clause, showing that he
really meant to combine Convocation with Parliament.
He says “quod quilibet [episcopus] praeimmirc laciat
priores decanos et capitula ecclesiarum suarum cathedralium
necnon archidiaconos et clerum suarum dioecesium, quod
iidem priores decani et archidiaconi in propriis personis
suis, et quodlibet capitulorum praedictorum per unum,
clerusque cujuslibet dioeceseos per duos procuratores
sufficientem potestatem ab ipsis capitulo et clero habentes,
dictis die et loco intersint,'’ etc*

The Convocation ol York was also summoned to
assemble at York on the lllonday alter the Octave ol the
Epiphany (13th Jannary, 1334), and again, by a King’s
Writ, on the Monday alter the Feast ol St. Catherine the
Virgin (25th November, 1334).

xxxii. A Royal Writ, lollowed by the Archbishop’s
llandate, led toa meeting ol Convocation on the Wednesday
alter St. Luke’s Day (18th October, 1335).

xxxiii. Α Convocation was summoned by a Royal
Writ, dated 21st August, 1337, addressed to the Archbishop.
lt states at large the reasons for which the King desired
a subsidy. The Archbishop’s Mandate summons Convoca-
tion to meet on the Wednesday next alter the Nativity ol
the Virgin (tlth September. 1337). The subsidy voted
(via, the hall ol a tenth) seemed to the King so much
below what he wanted that he instructed the Archbishop
to summon Convocation again. They met on the Wednes·
day alter St. Martin's Day (11th November, 1337) at
York, and granted the King, as a subsidy, a two-years'
tenth on all the goods and benefices ecclesiastical in the
province; and this the Archbishop signihed lormally to
the Abbot ol St. lllary's, York, as Collector. This brief
was dated lrom Cawode on the 17th December, 1337.
