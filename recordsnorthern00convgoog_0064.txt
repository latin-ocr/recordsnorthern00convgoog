that there was tmth in this remonstrance, lor he got
leave lrom the Kiug to withdraw with his clergy. They
held their Convocation within the bounds of his province.

His letter on the subject to Bishop Beaumont, of Durham‚
is interesting.

ln the Close Rolls lor 1336 'we find a Royal Writ
urging the N orthem Convocation to vote a ready subsidy,

because ol Scottish troubles, adding that, as Canterbury
had been liberal, York should not lag.

Another peculiar incident occurred in the Convoca-
tion ol 1339. When Edward ΙΙΙ called on the Archbishop
lor help to protect realm and church, he found the
Convocatiou very unwilling to vote an aid, and writes,
“ Though Canterbury has consented, York still holds out,
‘uude plurimum mirabamur ’ ’'-would, then, the Arch-
bishop call another Convocation, and see to it that he got
the vote passed? This royal writ,* dated at Byfleet,
near Weybridge in Surrey, is witnessed by Edward the
Black Prince. Convocation, summoned accordingly,
voted a two years’ tenth, with no stipulations; later,
however, it was otherwise. Edward again sends his writ,
this time from Eastry in Kent, not far from Dover, to
Archbishop W. (William de la Zouche). The lling was

William (le la Zouche (¹343-1352l Now the writ has as a witness
‘⁶ Edward, Dulce ot Coruwall and Earl ot chester, our beloved son.''
This was the renowned Black Prince ot romance and history. He
was made Dulce and Earl in 1 3 36, and did not become Prince οΙ Wales
till ¹343· So that this firs rightly tor him. In ¹3 39 he was Dulce and
Earl, and so witnessed the writ.
