or 01 Scots, was Lord 01 Galloway. Thus in 1308, a
Papal Letter from Poitiers includes Whitheme among
the Scottish bishoprics (Bliss, Papal Registers, ΙΙ, 43),
but in 1326 a letter from Avignon to the Archbishop
01 York coneeming a papal subsidy numbers Whitheme
among his suffragans (Pap. Reg, ΙΙ, 478). Once again,
in 1340, 11 was reckoned as a Scotch see (Pap. Reg„ III,
311), whereas both in 1355 (Pap. Reg, Ill, 617) and in
1360 (Pap. Reg, ΙΙΙ, 631) 11 was included among the
suffragans 01 York. However, by 1372 it was again
treated as Scotch (Pap. Reg, lV, 101). Even in the
1111000111 century the ecclesiastical position 01 the diocese
was not definitely settled, 101 a letter 11010 Constance,
dated 8 Kal. March, 1418, included it in the province 01
York (Pap. Reg, V, 22), whereas a letter from Rome,
2 Non. December, 1422, directs that Alexander Vane,
on his translation from the see 01 Caithness to that 01
Whitheme shall take the usual oath 01 tealty to the
bishops 01 Glasgow and Dunkeld (Pap. Reg, V, 287).

The last change seems to have been hnal; alter the

the Bishop 01 Galloway became suffragan to the Arch-
bishop 01 Glasgow.
