Canterbury and of the late William Booth‚ Archbishop
of York, who had died before it could be collected. They
prayed that this subsidy should be presented to the Pope

for “aid and relies against the tyranny and emelty of
the Grand Turk.'’

Just before this (1463) we find York willingly
adopting Canterbury Constitutions, in the following
terms :—“ Quod praelati et clems in pr'aedicta Convoca-
tione volunt et concedunt unanimiter quod effectus
constitutionum provincialium cantuarensium ante haec
tempora tentarum et habitamm Constitutionibus provin·
ciae Eboracensis nullo modo repugnantium seu praejudi-
cialium, et non aliter, nec alio mode, admittantur, et
quod hujusmodi Constitutiones provinciae Eboracensis‚
prout indiget et decet, inserantur, et cum iisdem de
caetero incorporentur et pro jure observentur.”*

soon after this follows a Concilium Provinciale, a
sort of Great Convocation‚ at York, held in 1466, notable
as having been summoned by Archbishop Neville without
a Royal Writ. This body issued a Constitution which
shows that they were alarmed by the growth of Lollardism,

and hoped to meet the crisis by putting the Church in ’

order. The ‘⁴ Constitution '' sets in the front “the
ignoranee of priests‚'' and the folly of clerks, wh0, between
them, quite neglect to teach the people. They are
wamed to expound to their hearers “ in the vulgar
manner‚'' that is, in English, without fantastie texture or
subtilty, the fourteen articles of the faith, the Ten
Commandments, the two precepts of the Gospel (to love
God and to love the neighbour), and to fulfil the seven
works of mercy ; must wam their people against the seven
capital sim, and, finally, expound the seven sacraments;
