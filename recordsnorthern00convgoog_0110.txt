them in taxation.''* Thus carne in this new arrangement
01 which Bishop Gibson says that it was “the greatest
change ever made in the Constitutiorr‚''† ior, altertl1i5‚
Convocation became little more than an empty pageant.

In English history from 1664 onwards “the clergy
have been taxed at the same rate and by the same
machinery as the laity.'’ It is true thatin 1665 Parlia-
ment passed an Act, “under which the clergy were, in
common with the laity, charged with taxes voted by that
Act, and were discharged from the payrnent 01 the
subsidies they had previously granted in Convocation'';
yet 16 this same Act there is an express paragraph saving
the right 01 the clergy to tax themselves in their own
assemblies, should they think tit. This has never since
been done, nor apparently even thought 01. “ The clergy
have been constantly, from that time, charged 06 equal
terms with the laity in 611 public aids to the Crown by
the Housc of Commons.'’ Hallam adds that “probably
the arrangement with Archbishop Sheldon was founded
06 the practical difficulty 01 ascertaining the proportion
which the grant 01 the clergy ought to bear to the whole
in the new mode ol assessment.”‡

The result 01 this important change ivas the dis-
appearance ol 611 interest in convocation, so true it is
that power rests on the Money Bills. Take away this
control of expenditure, and in comes autocracy unchecked.
Throughout Charles II's reign the meetings 01 Convoca-

1106 were formal only ; and under James ll, though the
writs were still sent out, Convocation did 601 meet at all
lor business There is a record ol their meeting in 1689.
