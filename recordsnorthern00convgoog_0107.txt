the l'ork convrmtion met the same day in l'ork Minster.
ln very seernly lashion they opened their proceedings
nith a new {orm of prayer, which has been preserved to
us in the Acta. To give the Prayer the greater prominence
and dignity, it is not entered in the body ol the Acts, but
stands out on a separate page, lacing the beginning ol
these 1661 Acts. as if it was intended that this lorrn
should be used at the opening ol every Convocation.
llus Convocation appointed a Committee to act as
reynesentatives ol the Northem House, who were to meet
the Seuthem House at westminster. The Archbishop
ol York, the Bishops also ol Durham and (hester, sat

joint session was made in order that the whole English

lions in it; and presently issued the famous ‘⁴ Sealed

in the law to ull interests and purposes whatsoever‚ and
