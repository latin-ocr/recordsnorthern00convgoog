Phaeaca. xxvii

persons ol learning should be summoned to appear and
take part: “ipsique ariagnae literaturae viri providi et
maturi quicumque personaliter appareant.'' Similarly, Ι

besides the proetors, many officials had a right to sit.
In early days precentors are named, Treasurers,
Chancellors etc„ ol Cathedrals, and with them the
“ Prelates '' ol important churches In summoning all
these in 1408, the Archbishop adds an interesting proviso ε
“praelatis quoque ecclesiarum exemptarum non mendi-
cantibus* . . . cujuscumque luerint Ordinis.’' ln the
Northem Province the custodiens ol the peculiar jurisdic-
tions ol Howdenshire and Allertonshire were summoned
as Ordinaries; the officials ol Archdeacons also came.
On some important occasions the Chancellors ol Oxlord

and Cambridge were admitted to the Southem Convoca- ¹

tion. They never appeared at York, though it is inter·
esting to note that University College in Oxlord had the
power ol sending one proctor to York, as representing
the Church and Manor ol Amclifle in Craven, which
belonged to them. The Prior of Durham College had also
rights, as we see from a Bull ol Bonilace IX, oi appearing
in Convocation, or ol sending thither his proxy; and he
seems to have had this right, not lrom the College, but
from the livings which had been handed over to the
College lor its support. There was also a certain number
ol those puzzling people, the “ Decani.'' The Bishops, in
summoning these, named them sometimes before, some·
times alter, the Archdeacons. We lind in one passage
ol the year 1380 an unusual phrase about the persons
qualilied to appear in Convocation, who were summoned
as clergy ‘¹ tam promoti quam non promoti,'’† together

⁸ This indicates the jealousy with which the F riars were regarded
in the hlteenth century.
