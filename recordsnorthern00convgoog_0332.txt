14911 had ravaged the borderS, so inflicting great loss
on the Northern Counties. This enabled Henry Vll to
levy large sums on the pretext ot deieuce. In 1497 the
Scottish King laid siege to Norham Castle, on the south
bank ol the Tweed; but, being easily outflanked by the
English troops, who, under the Earl oi Surrey, had occupied
Ayton in Berwickshire, they raised the siege ot Norbam.
Ere long a truce followed, and Perkin had to leave Scotland.

claim to levy tenths, etc„ in England by a Bull. This
Convocation was prorogued to 15th October, 1502, and
then voted a tenth to the King as a subsidy “ for the
support and deience oi the Christian religion against the
perfidious Turk.'' lt was granted with the usual limita·
