months of the tragedy ol the 3oth January, 1641. The
tirst of their Canons dealt with the Kingly power: “ Every
parson, vicar, curate, or preacher. upon some one Sunday
in every quarter of the year at hloming Prayer shall read
these explanations oi the regal power here inserted '’ ; and
it affirms bravely “that the most high and sacred order

when Parliament had refused all supplies, and had been
peremptorily, hut vainly, dissolved by his Majesty.
And the second Canon deals with “the better keeping ol
the day of His Majesty's most happy inauguration.'’

York, where the Convocation is but the hand of the dial,
