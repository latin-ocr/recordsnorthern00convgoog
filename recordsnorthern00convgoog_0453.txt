homnem Convocxrrox‘. 329

On the roll lor 1701 only three names are marked
specially with the word ptr. (personaliter), but the roll ’
does not state whether any proctors lor the others appeared.
Probably not, lor the names marked with “ personaliter ’'
were :-

The Dean ol York.

Thomas Gale, S.T.P.

James Fell, S.T.P., who was Proctor lor
Knightley Chetwood, S.T.P., Archdeacon ol

York.

and in the usual ‘¹ Proclamation '' we find the signatores
to be those ol Gale and Fell.

by King James 11, on the 14th March, 1687. lt has leit
no record in the York Registers

Convocation summoned sat on the 29th October, 1689,
and was dissolved by the Crown on the 8th February,
1090. The York Register says that this Convocation was
bcgun without a Royal Writ, and that it sat on the 18th
October, 1689, in the first year ol William and Mary.

The last Convocation registered in the York Registry
appears to have been that which sat on the aoth May,
1095. There is, however, no record ol business, beyond
the names ol those who were present. Convocation, how-
ever, certainly was summoned, and held sittings in 1698
arrd 1701, apparently only ol a formal kind. So that
though the Southem Convocation met several times between
1695 and up to 1710, the Northern House appears to have
shown only one sign ol real lile, when it met to reply to
Queen Anne in the matter ol the Bounty, in 1703-4.
