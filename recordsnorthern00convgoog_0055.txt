their churches have been rated by the '‘ Bishop of
Norwich's taxation,’' at ten marks, with, in addition, a
tenth to the King ior a Crusade.*

ln addition to Aids and Gravamina, Convocation was
also called on to protect orthodoxy, and to eradicate
heresy. ln the beginning ol the records oi the body we
find the Trial ol the Templars ; later on there is a curious
trial oi one Thomas Richmond, aman touched, no doubt,
with Lollardry. With less vehemence than Canterbury,
York. was strongly hostile towards the followers ol
Wicklifie. Convocation could also take action on petitions,
which were a kind ol Gravamina irom the outside. Thus,
ior example, they received and acted on a complaint
addressed to them by graduates oi Oxiord and Cambridge,
who contended that, as men oi letters, and graduales
they had a neglected claim ior preierment, too much
iorgotten in the giving oi benefices.†

From early days they held the power oi making
CanonS, which the Bishops should promulgate. These
appear irom the days oi Edward 1. Thus they toolr
active part in the discipline and organization oi the
Church, and betrayed to posterity some oi her weak
points. ln moral matters they 'retained certain rights oi
judgement. We find early an order lrom them that the
Constitutions oi Cardinal Otto,‡ with those oi his successor
as Legate, Ottobuoni‚§ should be considered and put in

' Wilkins, Concilio, ΙΙ, ro. This ‘¹ taxatio Norwycensis¹’ seems
always to have been a real grievance.

γ “ Pro graduatis in iisdem ad beneficia promovendis,'' a complaint
laid in 1422.

ἶ Otto (Otho) was legate in Englan‹l; cardinal ol St. Nicholas in
Cercere Tulliano.

§Ottobuoni was also Legate, and cardinal oi St. hdrinn. He
had the curious career oi being elected Pope, as hdrian V, in 1270, and
held this supreme position only 3o days, when he died. These t'on-
stitutions are printed in lull in Willrins' Consilia.
