Nonrurmv Convocxrrox. 331

Predecessors since the Reformation. They took care

that our holy Religion should be purged from thc errors
and superstitions with which Popery had corrupted it,
and they tooke care likewise that it should be transmitted
to us, and for this their memorie will be for ever blessed.
But your Majestie not only takes care to preserve our
religion in the same purety and to protect our Church
in 011 115 legall rights and privileges but has further
taken care also that the ministers of it should in due
time have a competent maintenance, the want of which
provision was indeed the great, if not the only, blemish
of our Reformation; And therefore doubly blessed will
your Majestie’s memory be in all succeeding generations.
As we are sure that this pious and charitable gift of your
llfajestie is highly acceptable to God, who 10115 not to
recompence even a cup 01 cold water given to a Prophet
in the name 01 0 Prophet, so we cannot but hope it will
have such an effect upon all your Majestie's subjects
who love our Church and Religion, and especially upon us
01 the Clergie, that we shall endeavour more and more
(if it be possible) to express our zeal 101 your Majestie’s
service; And particularly we shall think ourselves
obliged every day to put up our most eamest prayers 10
(iod Almighty lor your Majestie's long life and happy
reigne over us, and that for this exceeding goodness of
your Maiestie He would add an abundant increase to
the glorious rewards that, we doubt not, are laid up for
you in His Heavenly Kingdom.
