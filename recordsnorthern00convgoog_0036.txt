the time ol the famous assemblies of clergy in 1204 and
1295 z synods which are called by Bishop Stubbs, in their
connexion with the Parliaments oi those years “a
model assembly,’' bearing, he says, ⁴‘ iu i s constitution
evidence ol the principle by which the summons was
dictated, and serving as a pattem ior all future assemblies
ol the nation.”* He also adds that “the events oi the
year. although they show unconstitutional violence on
the part ol the King, and somewhat ol panic on the part¹
of the nation‚ mark the acquisition by the clergy and the
counties oi the right ol representation in their proper
assemblies, andan acknowledgement oi the need of their

consent to taxation; two steps which were never re-
voked.'’†

ln this synod ot 1295 occurs a remarkable appeal to
English patriotism. The F rench King, who had already
seized Gascony, was threatening dire things against
this country: Edward l says, “linguam Anglicanam,
si conceptae iniquitatis proposito detestabili potestas
correspondeat, quod Deus avortat! omnino de terra
delere proponit.'' How well had the sense ol national life
thriven in this country, when King Edward appeals so ! It
is another evidence ol his wise sagacity; he accepted the
victory oi the English language over the Norman F rench.

gregatio. Α little later the word seems firm : in 1297, only two years
alter “ the model assembly,'¹ the Archbishop’s writ is headed with
¹¹ citatio pro convocatione,” and this probably is the first use oi the
word in the modern sense. lt is similarly used in the writs of 1314.
From this time onwards it is in recognized uaeas the appellation ol
the two synods. ln the Coventry Mystery there is the following
stage-direction, “the coonselhous belom-sayd shal sodeynlie onclose,
schewing the bushopys prestys and jewgys syttyng in here estat lyche
ns it were a Convocacyon.”
