Ηο orders the Hospitallers to do their duty, to be honest,

At this very time Convocation interposes with effect,
in July, 1311, on behall 01 Bishop Walter Langton.
He was then confined in prison on the King's orders,
The letter was sent by Archbishop Greneleld, h’ellawe
Bishop 01 Durham, and Dalton 01 Whithem, with the
rest 01 the clergy present in this provincial Synod.
Carlisle and Man were not there. Edward 1 Ι had arrested
Langton on coming to his throne, as we are told by Speed ε
“ The first taste which Edward gave 01 his luture
behaviours at home was a vigorous revenge taken by him
upon Walter de Langton, Bishop 01 [Coventry Lichfield,
and] Chester, Treasurer 01 England and principall executor
01 the last Will 01 the deceased King . . . . The Rishop's
crime was a kinde 01 good lreedome which he used ln the
late King's dales, in gravely reproving the Prince 101 his
misdemeanourS, and shortening his waste 01 coyne by a
hugal moderatim: and particularly that he had com-
playned 01 Piers Gavest0n; whereupon ensued Prince
Edward's imprisonment and the other’s banishment; an
therefore coming now to the crowne he arrested the

Bishop and imprisoned him in Wallingiord Castle.''†
The Bishop, we find, was “ reconciled with the King in
1312.’'

In the lourteenth century Convocation mostly voted
aids, though there were some few points 01 interest.
