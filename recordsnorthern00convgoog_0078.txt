importance ol help at the time, both lor England and for
France‚ 'lor these were days ol great tension; and
though, somewhat later, the Earl of Northumberland
and Richard Neville again laid the case before Con·
vocatiou, they still insisted that they should be
dissolved without coming to a vote, until at last the
Bishop of Durham, holding that he had no power to
dissolve, adjoumed Convocation to a distant day, and so
successfully evaded the difficulty.

Once more in these days we lind a combined action
between the two provinces and this was over the well-
known Statute of Praemunire.* This statute ol 1353
declared outlawry or lorleiture lor any one who dealt in
loreign courts lor matters which might be dealt with in
the royal courts.† Another statute ol the same name
was passed twelve years later, in 1365, and definitely

denied the jurisdiction ol the Papal courts. The joint
petition of the clergy, which was issued about a hundred
years later, was both a protest against any such appeal
or reference to the papal Curia, and also an illustration
oi the combined action ol the two Convocations.

ln Archbishop William Booth’s Register‡ there is a
curious summons to a Convocation to be holden at
Durham about this time. lt shows what the Durham
contingent to an assembly ol the kind was in those days

*this statute has nothing to do with that “l‘raomuuientes
Clause '' which is lountl in the royal summons ol the thirteeuth century.
That clause directed the electors as to their rights, in the new constitution
ol Convocatiom and the statute ol r 353 was a protest ol the natioual

, or royal power against the clairns ol the papacy or other loreign

authority to hear English causes in their courts.
