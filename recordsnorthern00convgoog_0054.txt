Parracis. xxxiii

The business transacted by the Convocations was
limited from the beginning, the most prominent side ol it
being their power ol voting aids and subsidies* This
gave lile to these synods, so that when, in the seventeeuth
century, Convocation lost this power over money, it never
showed any further vigour,† met but rarely, and only
formally, and was as good as dead. lt had completely
ceased to be a power in the State. ln the records oi the
York Convocation we see that ior many years no real
business was transacted; the sessions were very thinly
attended; the threat of exeommunication raised nothing
but a laugh.

Yet there was a possibility ol more valuable work.
ln the opening days, we read thot, when summoned
to vote an aid, Convocation, before voting it, drew up
a list ol Gravamina. These are still called lor in
Convocation, and sometimes discussed at the opening oi
the business oi the session. These early Gravamiua are
interesting: that the English Church in lormer days
hasbeen aggrieved (1) by a 4oth, 30th, aoth, 15th, even
a roth, paid to the King by the clergy, even when there
was no war; (2) they have also suffered damage by the
ravages made on them by the enemy ; (3) they have also
been badly aggrieved by the burden of our Lord the
Legate ol the Pope lately in England ; (4) and intolerably
oppressed by a three years' tenth to the King, ‘⁴ tarn iu
capite quam in membris ” ; (5) because their manors and
other temporal possessions have been taxed by the laity

in deliance ol Canon Law; and (ὁ) by the grievance that

* ln ¹²9¹ an ecelesiastical tenth was taken as being equal to
ραιοοος in Henry Vll's day (1497) it had fallen to just the hall ol
that sum.

† “The old contentione, once so ehorp, on the relations between
Convocation and Parliament ceased to be urgent, when (onvocation
no longer voted supplies.''-Sce Stubbe, C. H, 111, 346.
