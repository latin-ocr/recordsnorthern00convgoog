In the following year, 1535, Fuller tells us that a
reformed Convocation sat on the oth oi June. He says
of it, “On the eighth oi June began a short but sharp
Parliament, dissolved on the 18th luly following, effecting
much in little time, matters, it seems, being well prepared
alorehand and the house assembled not to debate, but
to do the King's desires. The parallel Convocation
began the day alter, being one new-modelled and ol a
iashion different irorn all lonner Convocations There
the Lord Cromwell, prime secretary, sat in state above
all the bishops as the King's vicar or vice-gerentgeneral
in all spiritual matters.’'* In the Canterbury Convoca-
tion there were always two distinct Houses; at York
they still sat together. ‘⁴ The lower, ol the clerks and
proctors ol their respective cathedrals and dioceses, with
deans and archdeacons therein; the upper. ol the bishopS,
with the lord abbots and priors (l mean so many ol thern
as voted as barons in Parliament) . . . . Ι lind not the
abbots active in any degree in canvassing matters ol
religion. Whether this proceeded lrom any desire of
ease, their laziness being above their learning, or out ol
humility, counting it rnore proper to permit such disputes
to the sole disposal oi the bishops, as most concerned
therein, or out ol lear, both to stickle on religion, knowing
on what ticklish tenns they stood.''†
