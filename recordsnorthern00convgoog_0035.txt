Archbishop's messengers This excess oi contempt roused
not unnatural anger in the Archbishop, and he launched
against Bek a sentence ol iull excommunication, on the
8th April, 1202* History does not trouble itsell to tell
us when or how the unlucky envoys were set lree from the
Durham round tower, nor how the Palatine Bishop was
reconciled with his Archbishop.

On one occasion we find a kind of apology made by
the Archbishop lor the non-appearance oi this magnificent
prelato. He writeS, “ Antony, our venerable brother, who
does not appear, we excuse on this occasion, both because
ol the reverence due to his patriarchal dignity (ior he
had been appointed by Pope Clement V Patriarch oi
Jerusalem in 1305) and also by reason oi the well-known
irailty of his health.’' lt will be seen that the Archbi'shop
avoids the question as to the rights ol the Palatine
bishops in the matter.

Though as yet we do not find the word Convocation

cum archidiaconis et Abbatibus et Prioribus tuae dioeceseos ad defini-
endum super negottts ecclesiasticis et ad informandum seu corrigendum
quae informanda seu corrigenda docuerit sententia Convocationis
nostrae.'' Here it simply means a nreeting or synod ol clergy summoned
by royal writ. Archbishop Bonilace seems to be tho tirst to use the
word in the more modern and technical use ; lor in 12 5 7, in his mandate,
he uses the term as a definite assembly ot Clergy: ¹‘ lecit Bonitacius
